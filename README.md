üéØ Project Overview
This repository showcases my journey into Reinforcement Learning through AWS DeepRacer - a gamified platform that teaches RL concepts through autonomous racing. As an aspiring AI/ML Software Engineer, this project demonstrates my ability to design, train, and optimize RL models for real-world applications.
üß† What is Reinforcement Learning?
Unlike supervised learning that relies on labeled datasets, Reinforcement Learning enables models to learn through interaction with an environment. The agent (our race car) learns optimal behaviors by:

Taking actions in an environment
Receiving rewards for good decisions
Learning from mistakes through trial and error
Continuously improving performance over time

This approach is fundamental to autonomous systems, robotics, and AI decision-making.
üèÅ Technical Implementation
Model Architecture

Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Neural Network: Convolutional layers for image processing

Training Data Files
The data/ directory contains .npy files representing the learning progression:

model_weights_episode_1000.npy - Early training weights
model_weights_episode_2500.npy - Mid-training optimization
model_weights_final.npy - Final optimized model
reward_history.npy - Reward progression over training episodes
action_distribution.npy - Analysis of action space exploration

üéÆ Reward Function Strategy
My custom reward function balances multiple objectives:
pythondef reward_function(params):
    # Racing line optimization
    # Speed incentivization
    # Boundary penalty system
    # Progress tracking
    # Smooth steering rewards
Key innovations:

Progressive Speed Rewards: Higher rewards for maintaining speed on straights
Racing Line Optimization: Bonus rewards for optimal track positioning
Stability Penalties: Reduced rewards for erratic steering behavior
